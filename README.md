what is EEG?
Its is a device from which our brain activities in the form of signals can be recorded.
#
#
So we can build and DL ML model for human emotion recognition, epilepsy seizure detection and many more.
#
#feature extraction from eeg datasets
The features are being extracted using various feature extraction techniques to get the better result from EEg based Datasets.
#
METHOD
#
Use Discrete Wavelet Transform (Waveletpacket Decomposition in the paper) and Autoregressive Model to extract the features of EEG signals. 
DWT is used to get the frequency bands corresponding to mu-rhythm and beta-wave.

#DATASET

BCI Competition 2003 Dataset III.
The file description.doc contains detailed information about the dataset.
